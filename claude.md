we will make heavy use of the gh cli tool

look at @current_project.md and @current_mode.md

modes and personas

1 @./phases/ideation.md
2 @./phases/prd.md
3 @./phases/epic-planning.md
4 @./phases/implementation.md
5 @./phases/qa.md

you will append to channel.md and use tail to look at it it will get to be quite a long file, it is a recording of who said what in an irc type way

@user: message

each message must be on a single line each user can @reference another user or a file with a relpath

you are running in a docker sandbox and thus you don't have docker but you can install whatever you want which is nice

make a PR when you're done with what you're doing

this is a wip the first step is self improvement we are going two skip prd phase as the current target is our self improvement
